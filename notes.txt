CARD:
Has CardData -> Type, Mana Cost, ATK/HP, Name, Rarity, Image etc.

Deck contains Cards (as data) (Really just an array of CardData and # in deck)
Hand also contains Cards
Graveyard also contains Cards (maybe also tokens)

Battlefield doesn't necessary have cards, but Permanents (a different entity despite being generated by cards).
When a Permanent dies/is destroyed, it adds a card to graveyard.

Card
- Can be flipped, rotated and moved by predetermined routes and animations.
- Can be dragged around when not locked by an existing animation.
- When hovered over in hand, enlarges card.
- When dragged to certain areas, causes an action if possible.

Card
- CardData
  - BaseCardData
  - Enchantments
  - Buffs/Nerfs (t.ex. ManaCost -1)
- CardRenderer
    is_locked (in animation)
    currently_dragged (by player)
    face_up (boolean)
    position / rotation
    rotation of card in 3d space

    transform_to(location, rotation, time)
    flip(time)
    set_z_index(z_index)

For example drawing a card form the deck:
instantiate
set position to deck position
set face_up to false
add as child of hand
transform to position above deck
flip card during animation
recalculate hand positions
make all cards in hand move to new locations using transform_to()
